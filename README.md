**SHORT DESCRIPTION**

This project uses the diabetes dataset for data analysis and machine learning.

**DETAILED DESCRIPTION**

The diabetes.csv dataset is a supervised learning dataset used to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical features. It contains both independent variables (like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more) and a dependent variable called Outcome, which indicates whether the patient is diabetic (1) or not (0). This target column is a categorical variable with binary values, making it ideal for classification tasks. All other columns in the dataset are numeric â€” some are continuous (e.g., BMI, glucose), while others are discrete (e.g., pregnancies, age). This dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models, performing exploratory data analysis, and studying the relationship between health indicators and diabetes.
